# macOS Signoff Evidence Index

Updated: 2026-09-18

This index records accepted Apple macOS runtime signoff evidence for openQ4. It is intentionally lightweight: large `.tar.gz` signoff archives stay in `.tmp/` while work is active and should be attached to release evidence, issue discussion, or another external artifact store instead of being committed to the repository.

macOS stays a preview, not first-class, unless the current release entry below points to a completed-checklist archive that passes validation. The preview itself rests on hosted CI plus the community hardware reports recorded below; those reports are not accepted signoff archives and cannot promote macOS to first-class.

## Evidence Rules

- Use only compliant Apple hardware, a VM running on Apple hardware, or a hosted Apple Mac provider.
- Collect final evidence with `tools/macos/Invoke-openQ4MacOSWorkflow.ps1 -Action CollectResults -MacOSRunId <id> -MacOSGraphicsBridge both -RequireCompletedSignoffChecklist`.
- Keep `<id>` to 80 or fewer characters using only letters, digits, dots, underscores, or dashes, starting with a letter or digit.
- Validate the collected archive with `python tools/macos/validate_signoff_archive.py <archive> --require-completed-checklist`.
- Record accepted evidence with `python tools/macos/record_signoff_evidence.py <archive> --version vX.Y.Z --update-index` after adding package artifact names, signing status, and release-note limitations.
- Record the SHA-256 of the exact archive that passed validation.
- Record the openQ4 commit and game-source inventory used to build the modules.
  Reports retain the historical `openQ4-game` commit field for compatibility;
  current in-tree builds set both commit fields to the same openQ4 SHA.
- Record the architecture policy, actual CPU architecture, and OS matrix role for the run. Use `OPENQ4_MACOS_OS_MATRIX_ROLE=floor-candidate` for oldest-supported-version signoff and `OPENQ4_MACOS_OS_MATRIX_ROLE=latest-public-macos` for current public macOS signoff.
- Record Xcode and macOS SDK versions from the signoff report so CI/package evidence can be matched to the Apple toolchain that produced it.
- Record the OpenAL provider, package artifact names, signing/notarization status, and any user-facing limitation that release notes must mention.
- Record the matching macOS dSYM symbol archive names and confirm that `SYMBOLS.txt` from the package root matches the runtime artifacts under test.
- Do not promote macOS to first-class until evidence covers both the documented floor and the latest public macOS release, or the support matrix explicitly narrows the claim.
- Use the renderer/backend policy in `docs/dev/macos-renderer-backend-policy.md` and the containment policy in `docs/dev/macos-native-backend-containment-policy.md`: record OpenGL and Metal bridge evidence separately, do not treat the Metal bridge as native Metal, and do not treat `platform_backend=native` as release support evidence.
- Do not mark a release entry complete if either bridge report has open checklist items.
- Do not mark a release entry complete if SP, MP, Finder launch, terminal launch, input, audio, display, or package-layout checks were skipped without a documented exception.
- Use the package contract in `docs/dev/macos-package-layout-and-release-policy.md`: the client is a self-contained drag-installable app with data under `Contents/Resources/baseoq4` and signed modules under `Contents/Frameworks`.
- Record mounted-DMG launch, dragged-app launch, whole-package loose-tool launch, embedded path/module checks, path-resolution logs, and Gatekeeper assessment for the package artifacts under test.

## Current Status

- [ ] No completed macOS first-class support evidence is recorded yet.
- [ ] The next macOS signoff archive must include OpenGL and Metal bridge result directories.
- [ ] The next macOS signoff archive must include `renderer-smoke`, `renderer-mp-smoke`, and `renderer-matrix` evidence for each bridge.
- [ ] The next macOS signoff archive must include completed manual checklist items for SP, MP, Finder launch, terminal launch, input, audio, display, and package behavior.
- [ ] The next macOS signoff archive must include mounted-DMG, independently dragged-app, whole-package loose-tool, embedded resource/module path, `fs_basepath`/`fs_cdpath`/`fs_savepath`, and Gatekeeper evidence.
- [ ] The next macOS signoff archive must include architecture policy, CPU architecture, OS matrix role, Xcode version, and macOS SDK version.
- [ ] The next macOS signoff archive must include the engine and legacy game commit fields in each bridge report, both naming the same openQ4 SHA for an in-tree build.
- [ ] The next macOS signoff archive must keep OpenGL and Metal bridge renderer evidence separate and must not describe the Metal bridge as native Metal.
- [ ] Before first-class promotion, accepted evidence must include both a macOS floor-version signoff and a latest-public-macOS signoff for the current Apple Silicon/arm64 matrix.
- [ ] `docs/dev/release-completion.md` must reference the accepted evidence before macOS support claims are promoted.

- [ ] `renderer-smoke` output exists for Metal.
- [ ] `renderer-mp-smoke` output exists for OpenGL.
- [ ] `renderer-mp-smoke` output exists for Metal.

- [ ] `renderer-matrix` output exists for Metal.
- [ ] SP entered an in-game map on real Apple hardware.
- [ ] MP loaded `game-mp`, started `mp/q4dm1`, connected a local client, and exited cleanly.
- [ ] Dedicated server startup was covered or explicitly documented as unsupported for this release.
- [ ] Finder or Desktop launcher startup was checked.
- [ ] Terminal startup was checked.
- [ ] Mounted signed/notarized DMG launch was checked, or unsigned archive behavior was recorded as an unsigned-package exception.
- [ ] Dragging only `openQ4.app` to `/Applications` or another user-writable location was checked.
- [ ] Whole-package copied launch was checked for loose client, dedicated-server, and support-tool sibling-runtime discovery.
- [ ] `fs_basepath`, `fs_cdpath`, and `fs_savepath` were confirmed in logs for Finder/copied package and terminal launches.
- [ ] Gatekeeper assessment was checked for signed/notarized DMGs, or unsigned/unnotarized approval friction was recorded for development archives.

## Community Hardware Reports

These are reports from players on real Apple hardware, taken from GitHub issues. They are what moved macOS from experimental to preview on 2026-09-18. None of them is an accepted signoff archive: no checklist was run, no archive was validated, and none counts toward first-class promotion. Add newer reports at the top, and remove the preview if a current release stops reaching gameplay on the latest public macOS.

| Date | Release and package | Hardware and macOS | Result | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-09-13 | 0.13.1, `openq4-0.13.1-macos-arm64-opengl-unsigned` | MacBook Air (M2, `Mac14,15`), macOS 26.6 | New Game from the main menu played for about five minutes. Scripted loads of `game/mcc_1` and `game/airdefense1` reached gameplay with no errors and wrote autosaves. OpenAL Soft 1.25.1 loaded with EFX and an HRTF available, and sound was confirmed audible by ear. Exclusive fullscreen ran at the native 2880x1864. | [#122](https://github.com/themuffinator/openQ4/issues/122) |
| 2026-09-03 | 0.12.0, clean install | MacBook Pro (M4 Max), macOS 26.6 | Multiplayer started with sound and without the washed-out lighting of earlier builds, and the reporter said the Vulkan renderer worked too. Single-player hit the Apple OpenAL buffer exhaustion that 0.13.0 fixed. | [#98](https://github.com/themuffinator/openQ4/issues/98) |
| 2026-08-13 | 0.8.0 | Apple Silicon, two reporters | The launch `SIGSEGV` was gone, as summarized when the issue was closed. | [#73](https://github.com/themuffinator/openQ4/issues/73) |
| 2026-08-12 | 0.10.0, built from source | iMac (2020, Intel), macOS 26 (first reported on 15.7.7) | The launch `SIGABRT` reported since 0.8.0 was gone. Intel is still not a published target. | [#90](https://github.com/themuffinator/openQ4/issues/90) |

Still unreported on real hardware: any macOS older than 26, the Metal bridge package on a current release, multiplayer on 0.13.x, the dedicated server with stock maps, controllers, audio device switching, and signed-package Gatekeeper behavior.

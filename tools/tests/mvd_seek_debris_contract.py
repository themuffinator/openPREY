"""Guards MVD seeks dropping client-only debris instead of freezing it.

A multi-view demo seek replays snapshot records without running game frames. Gibs,
brass and BSE debris are client moveables whose physics and fade-out only advance
on frames, so those spawned during the replay stayed frozen where they spawned:
clusters of gibs inside a body, often at the death camera, which showed as the
distorted foreground debris the Red Rover seek finding recorded.

The checks pin the parts no compiler sees together:

* the engine publishes a read-only mvd_seeking exactly while seekInProgress is
  set, at every place that flag changes;
* the game reads it only during server demo playback;
* every client moveable spawned while it is set removes itself on the first
  event service, which the presentation frame ending the seek runs before
  anything is drawn.

Single-reversal controls then mutate the sources and require each check to fail.

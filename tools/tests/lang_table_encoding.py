"""Regression checks for text encoding and the code-point font path.

openPREY text is UTF-8 end to end.  String tables are authored in it, the loader
normalises a legacy 8-bit table *up* to it (idLangDict::Load), and the GUI draws
by Unicode code point rather than by byte, so a language is limited by what the
fonts have art for rather than by what one 8-bit codepage can express.

Four things therefore have to stay true:

  * every repo-authored ``.lang`` file is valid UTF-8, and every code point in it
    is one the engine actually builds a glyph for - anything else draws as a
    question mark;
  * the codepage tables in the engine match the real Windows codepages.  They
    are no longer the rendering path, but they still decode retail tables and
    still index the retail bitmap atlases, and a wrong entry is not a missing
    glyph but a confidently wrong one - 0xB9 is superscript one in CP1252,
    a-ogonek in CP1250 and a soft hyphen in CP1251;
  * the code-point glyph lookup, the extended pages that back it, and the
    UTF-8 iteration in the text layer all stay in place;
  * a language the 256-glyph bitmap atlases cannot draw at all does not silently
    honour r_useTrueTypeFonts 0.

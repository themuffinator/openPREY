"""Guards the plumbing behind inline ^i icon escapes in GUI text.

Quake 4 text can embed an icon with a three character escape - "^iw07" in an
obituary line means "the railgun icon here".  The codes are content driven: the
game walks "icon <code>" spawn args while caching an entity def's media and
hands each one to uiManager->RegisterIcon.  def/player.def alone registers the
eleven weapon icons (w00-w10) and the two generic means-of-death icons (dm0 for
a plain frag, dm1 for a telefrag) that idMultiplayerGame::ReceiveDeathMessage
builds its HUD death lines from.

idUserInterfaceManager declares RegisterIcon with an empty inline body rather
than as a pure virtual, so an engine that never overrides it still links, still
runs, and silently drops every registration - idStr::IsEscape consumes "^iw07"
whatever happens, so the obituary keeps its text and just loses its icon.  That
is exactly what happened: the device context's hardcoded builtin list covered
the scoreboard and menu codes, nothing covered the means-of-death icons, and
the escapes rendered as nothing at all.  Pin the override.

Sizing has the same silent-failure shape.  An icon resolves its UVs from the
material's image dimensions, which are zero until the image is resident, and a
zero-height icon is skipped by every draw and measure path.  So the authored
rect has to survive registration, and something has to re-resolve icons that
were registered too early.

"""Measure high-refresh presentation (HF-03 to HF-08) in live gameplay without device input.

Runs staged clients on retail maps. The cheat-gated in_presentationViewProbe feeds
synthetic mouse counts through the ordinary mouse path at a constant rate, and
the extended g_presentationClockCapture records, for every prepared draw, the
host time, the drawn camera yaw, the authoritative view yaw, the late-look input
sample and owner counters. Scenarios:

- look: single player, late look off and on;
- thirdperson: the third-person camera on the tic and interpolated;
- death, ragdoll, debris: the death camera, AF ragdoll blending and client debris;
- vehicle: a spawned walker entered by script, its joint-bound cockpit eye
  turning under the probe;
- flash (HF-08): com_latencyFlash, the white bar click-to-photon sensors watch;
  latencyFlashTest arms it as an attack press would, and each arming must draw
  exactly one frame;
- flick: rapid turns, the probe at ten times its rate (2200 deg/s), late look
  off and on;
- zoom: a railgun held zoomed by the cheat-gated in_presentationViewProbeZoom,
  late look off and on (zoomed look turns at pm_zoomedSlow, 50%);
- lift: riding airdefense2's func_elevator_3 up a floor, late look off and on;
- subview (HF-06): views rendered inside each draw besides the main one, with
  late look on: tram1's bigScreen monitor (a cameraTarget remote view) and
  airdefense1's portal sky. r_rendererMetrics 2 runs for a moment so the case
  reports how many views and subview/remote packets each frame drew;
- combined (HF-06): one session with temporal AA, shadow maps, late look,
  retained UI and audio all on, captured live, after a save and load (a map
  reset), after vid_restart (new renderer resources) and after an AVI capture
  (the fixed-tic path); every capture must record draws and no gameplay, and
  screenshots under late look and TAA are kept for review;
- vr (HF-06): stereo frames through the in-tree OpenXR test runtime (selected
  for that process only by XR_RUNTIME_JSON), so both eyes of every draw pass the
  gameplay guard; the runtime's log counts the frames it received;
- demo (HF-06): a render demo recorded while late look turns and the capture
  runs, then played back by timeDemoQuit through the demo bypass in the same
  session;
- mphost: a loopback listen host's own player, late look off and on;
- mpclient: a remote client of a loopback listen host (client prediction), late
  look off and on;
- mploss: the remote client again with net_forceLatency 40, net_forceJitter 10
  and net_forceDrop 5 on the client (each way), so delayed, reordered and lost
  snapshots and commands make prediction replay and recover, late look off and
  on;
- spectate: a loopback listen host with two bots, playing, spectating free and
  following a bot; remote bodies join the presentation pass only while the
  local player spectates (listed= counts the pass);
- hitch (HF-07): once a second one frame stalls 100 ms
  (com_presentationStallProbe), so the game catches up several ticks; the drawn
  view must keep turning one way through it, late look off and on;
- menu (HF-07): the main menu, no map, at each --fps cap; menus follow
  com_maxfps like gameplay;
- hidden (HF-07): the same turn in a hidden window (r_hiddenWindow 1), which
  must present at about 60 Hz whatever the cap;
- minimized (HF-07): the same turn after the cheat-gated windowMinimizeTest
  minimizes the window, as leaving full screen does; it must also present at
  about 60 Hz, on every platform;
- pacing (HF-07): late look on at each --fps cap, judged against the declared
  240 Hz budget. Only --reference runs (a visible foreground window on the
  reference machine) qualify; every other run reports engine-side pacing;
- sensor (HF-08): an operator-driven session for click-to-photon sensors. The
  operator's own mouse works (the other cases never read devices), late look and
  com_latencyFlash are on, and for --sensor-seconds every fire press flashes the
  left edge; the snapshot then reports the engine's press-to-swap time for those
  same presses, to subtract from the sensor's readings;
- review (HF-08): operator-attended sessions for the by-eye review, best run
  --fullscreen on the reference machine. On-screen captions announce each
  segment while late look is switched off and on: steady and rapid turns under
  temporal AA, firing (muzzle flash, its light, tracers) through the
  cheat-gated in_presentationViewProbeAttack, third person, a ragdoll with
  barrel debris and the death camera on airdefense1; airdefense1's opening
  cinematic with its cuts; tram1's monitor. The engine-side checks still apply;
  the verdicts go in review-checklist.md, which the run writes for the
  operator.

For turning scenarios it reports the authoritative turn rate (input reaches the
game exactly once), input-to-draw latency against the input line, the drawn yaw
against the sampled input, and the frame-to-frame residual. Every scenario fails
if a prepared draw ran gameplay (event dispatch, scripts, physics or effect
spawns), which g_presentationClockCapture counts as gameplay=. Effects BSE
starts while the renderer services it (particle impacts, nested segments) are
reported apart as bse=; they start once per particle or effect step.

This is engine-side evidence on a hidden or visible window. It does not include
display scan-out, compositor or panel latency, and it is not physical input
qualification (HF-07/HF-08). MP cases bind 127.0.0.1 only.

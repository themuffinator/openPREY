"""Guards the agreements that keep combat effects visible to multiplayer clients.

A multiplayer client never runs idGameLocal::RunFrame - the engine drives it
through ClientReadSnapshot / ClientProcessReliableMessage / ClientPrediction.
Anything the effect system needs that is only maintained from the server frame
is therefore dead on a client, and the failure is silent: effects simply stop
appearing, with no warning and no crash.  Two of those went unnoticed for a long
time, so they are pinned here:

  * The BSE effect rate limiter is a leaky bucket per effect category.  It used
    to drain a fixed step per bse->StartFrame(), and the only StartFrame call
    site in the whole tree is idGameLocal::RunFrame.  On a client the bucket
    only ever filled, and nine EC_IMPACT effects after a map load every bullet
    impact effect was filtered for the rest of the map.  The drain must be
    driven by elapsed time and must happen on the way in to CanPlayRateLimited,
    so it cannot depend on any particular frame loop calling it.

  * idGameLocal::InPlayerConnectedArea answers from playerConnectedAreas, which
    only SetupPlayerPVS builds and only RunFrame calls.  With no connected-area
    set to consult it has to fail open, or rvClientEffect::Think marks every
    bound effect on a client as unreachable from the view.

The receive paths matter too: charging the rate limiter through both
CanPlayRateLimited() and Filtered() spends the budget twice per replicated
effect, and a NULL decl off the wire has to be rejected before it reaches
rvClientEffect.  The single-player tree was repaired for these; the multiplayer
tree is a separate fork and has to be checked independently.
